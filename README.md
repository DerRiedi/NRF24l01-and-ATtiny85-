# ATtiny85 & NRF24l01+  <======>  NRF24l01+ & ATtiny85
I wrote a little RISC assembly program for ATtiny85 to send data over NRF24l01+

### Summary
The transmitter side has a button. The receiver side has a LED. When the button is pressed on the one side, the LED is switched on, on the other side. 

To program the ATtinys I used AVR Studio 7.0 and an Arduino UNO as ISP.
